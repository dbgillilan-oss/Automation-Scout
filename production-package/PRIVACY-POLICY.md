# Automation Scout Privacy Policy & Compliance Guide

## üîí Privacy-First Design Principles

Automation Scout is built with privacy as a core foundation, not an afterthought. Every component is designed to minimize data collection, maximize user control, and ensure transparent operations.

## üìã Data Collection & Processing

### What We Collect
Automation Scout collects only the minimum data necessary for workflow automation:

| Data Type | Purpose | Retention | User Control |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Window Focus Events | Detect application switching patterns | Configurable (30-365 days) | Can pause/exclude apps |
| File Operation Patterns | Identify file workflow sequences | Same as above | Can exclude file types |
| URL Navigation | Detect web-based workflows | Domain only, no paths | Can exclude domains |
| Clipboard Events | Detect copy/paste patterns | Event type only, no content | Can disable entirely |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Detect automation triggers | Key combinations only | Can disable entirely |

### What We DON'T Collect
- **No keyboard content**: We detect key events, never the actual text typed
- **No sensitive file content**: File paths are hashed, content never accessed
- **No personal data**: No names, emails, addresses, or identification
- **No cloud storage**: All data stays on your local device
- **No network transmission**: Data never leaves your computer

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection Measures

### Encryption
```env
AS_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true
AS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-256-bit-key>
```
- All stored data encrypted with AES-256
- Encryption keys stored securely on local system
- Keys never transmitted or shared

### Data Redaction
```env
AS_REDACT_SENSITIVE_DATA=true
```
Four redaction levels available:
- **Paranoid**: Maximum privacy, pattern detection only
- **High** (Default): Heavy redaction, minimal data retention
- **Medium**: Redact obvious PII, keep workflow patterns
- **Low**: Store most data with basic filtering

### Audit Logging
```env
AS_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
```
Complete audit trail of all privacy-related actions:
- Data collection events
- Redaction operations
- User consent changes
- Data deletion requests

## üìù Consent Management

### Explicit Consent Required
```env
AS_CONSENT_REQUIRED=true
```

Users must explicitly consent to:
- Data collection for each application
- Specific types of monitoring (keyboard, clipboard, etc.)
- AI analysis of collected patterns
- Automation execution permissions

### Granular Controls
- **Per-application consent**: Allow/block monitoring per app
- **Data type consent**: Control keyboard, mouse, clipboard, file access
- **Time-based consent**: Set collection time windows
- **Automatic expiry**: Consent expires and requires renewal

### Consent Withdrawal
Users can withdraw consent at any time:
- Immediate cessation of data collection
- Option to delete existing collected data
- No impact on core application functionality

## üåç Regulatory Compliance

### GDPR Compliance (EU)
```env
AS_COMPLIANCE_GDPR_COMPLIANCE=true
AS_COMPLIANCE_DATA_CONTROLLER="Your Company Name"
AS_COMPLIANCE_DATA_PROCESSING_PURPOSE="workflow automation and optimization"
```

**Article 6 - Lawful Basis**: Consent (6.1.a) and Legitimate Interest (6.1.f)
- Clear consent mechanism for all data processing
- Legitimate interest for workflow optimization
- Easy consent withdrawal process

**Article 7 - Consent Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ Clear and plain language consent requests
- ‚úÖ Specific consent for different data types  
- ‚úÖ Easy withdrawal mechanism
- ‚úÖ Consent records maintained

**Article 17 - Right to Erasure**:
- ‚úÖ Delete all user data on request
- ‚úÖ Automatic data expiry based on retention policy
- ‚úÖ Secure deletion protocols

**Article 25 - Data Protection by Design**:
- ‚úÖ Privacy-first architecture
- ‚úÖ Minimal data collection
- ‚úÖ Default privacy settings
- ‚úÖ Built-in protection measures

### CCPA Compliance (California)
```env
AS_COMPLIANCE_CCPA_COMPLIANCE=true
```

**Right to Know**: Users can access all collected data
**Right to Delete**: Complete data deletion on request  
**Right to Opt-Out**: Easy consent withdrawal
**Non-Discrimination**: No service impact for privacy choices

### Industry-Specific Compliance

#### Healthcare (HIPAA)
```env
AS_COMPLIANCE_HIPAA_COMPLIANCE=true
```
- Enhanced encryption requirements
