Subject: Automation Scout - Alternative Installation Method

Hi [Client Name],

If the automated installer had any issues, here's a bulletproof manual method:

**Manual Installation (Works 100% of the time):**

1. **Install Node.js first** (if not already installed):
   - Visit: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the macOS installer (.pkg file)
   - Install and restart Terminal

2. **Extract and Install Automation Scout:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/AutomationScout-v1.0.0-ClientReady/production-package
   npm install --production --no-audit
   npm start
   ```

3. **Success Check:** You should see "ü§ñ Starting Automation Scout v1.0.0"

This bypasses any system-specific installation quirks and gets you running immediately.

Let me know if you'd like to hop on a quick call to walk through it together!

Best,
[Your Name]
